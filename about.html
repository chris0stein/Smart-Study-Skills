            <h3>Why was this Site Made?</h3>
            <p>A lot of college students have difficulty learning and remembering the material they are presented because they have never been taught any strategies to help them prepare for quizzes and exams and other assessments. The goal of this site is to give students some specific skills that they can begin to use to help them study smarter and more effectively.</p>
